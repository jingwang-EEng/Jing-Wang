* (actually I learned Organometallic Chemistry in that course)   


## ACADEMIC, RESEARCH & INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE

### Intern of Professor Catherine Mulligan in Concordia University in Canada | Since 09/2016 
*  Fully funded by __China Scholarship Council__ and **Canada Mitacs organization**
*  Do some research on the development of an in situ method for restoration of two eutrophic lakes using geotextiles
*  Participate in sampling of the lakes for the water and sediment quality on a regular basis (including COD, nutrient content, suspended solids, chlorophyll)
*  Will compile analysis information at the end of the period of the testing

### Assistant of Professor Hui Zhang in Wuhan University | Since 07/2018
* Conducted research on enhancing photocatalytic degradation of clofibric acid and bisohenol A using a g-C3N4/CeO2 heterojunction under visible light
*  Helped with the fabrication, characterization, stability and recyclability tests of photocatalyst (including SEM, XDR), and toxicity tests
*  Assisted in carrying out the whole experiment to investigate degradation of the pollutants under different conditions (including pH value, ratio of g-C3N4 and CeO2, amount of photocatalyst inhibitors, with and without PDS) and investigating into the mechanism.
*  Did some research on efficiency of the technique under actual water body (including Yangtze River and effluent of a sewage disposal plant)

### Team leader of a group of five in the Student Research Training Program in Wuhan University | 03/2018 - 10/2018
*  Did analyses of water (including BOD, COD, nitrogen content as well as sludge concentration)
*  Did some research about the restoration of Wuhan East Lake water via activated sludge process
*  Learned the anammaox process by myself and helped figure out the lab experimental plan
*  Gathered team members and have been leading them carrying out the research plan
*  Communicated with the guidance counselor on behalf of the whole team

### Assistant of associate Professor Hongping Wang in Wuhan University | 10/2017 - 03/2018
